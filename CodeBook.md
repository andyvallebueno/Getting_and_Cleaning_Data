This raw data set reflects the results of experiments "carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist." With the phone's accelerometer and gyroscope, information on 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity was captured at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments were video-recorded to label the data manually. "The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data." [1]

"The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used." [1]

###Variables from the raw data set

"The features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ. These time domain signals (prefix 't' to denote time) were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. Then they were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. Similarly, the acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals (tBodyAcc-XYZ and tGravityAcc-XYZ) using another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz. 

"Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals (tBodyAccJerk-XYZ and tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ). Also the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm (tBodyAccMag, tGravityAccMag, tBodyAccJerkMag, tBodyGyroMag, tBodyGyroJerkMag). 

"Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing fBodyAcc-XYZ, fBodyAccJerk-XYZ, fBodyGyro-XYZ, fBodyAccJerkMag, fBodyGyroMag, fBodyGyroJerkMag. (Note the 'f' to indicate frequency domain signals). 

"These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:
'-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions."

A set of variables was then estimated from these signals including mean and standard deviation.

## Transformation
The transformation comprised in the R script run_analysis.R uses this raw data and transforms it into a tidy data set named xtable2. 

1. It begins by reading the features, activity_labels, subject_test, x_test, y_test, subject_train, x_train and y_train files from the raw data set into R. This is included as step 1.1 in the script. 
2. The function then adds labels to the x_test and x_train tables by binding together these tables with the respective subject and Y files, so as to include the subject ID and activity type per observation. These are inclulded as two columns to the left of the x_test and x_train tables. This is included as step 1.2 in the script. 
3. The function then merges the train and test data by adding a new column (Test/Train in the final output) which specifies whether the observation is related to the Test or Train dataset. After this column is added, the function binds the rows from each dataset together. This is included as step 1.3 in the script.
4. The function then extracts from this large table the measurements that are related to Mean or Standard Deviation. From the features vector, it finds these variables (2.1 in R script) and creates a new table with only these variables (2.2 in R script). The function then adds the values to the new table by reading each row of the previous table and extracting from the character string only those values related to the Mean and Standard Deviation (2.3 in R script). 
5. The function then uses the activities file to read through each observation of the new table and assign the name of the correct activity as per the number specified in the table (3.0 in R script).
6. The function then appropriately lavels the new data table with descriptive variable names. For this step, variable names were expanded to be readable. For example, fBodyBodyGyroJerkMag-std() was described as Standard Deviation - Frequency domain representation of body angular velocity from jerk magnitude. For an easier read, at the beginning of each variable the table specifies whether the value is a Mean or Standard Deviation. This was step 4.0 in the R script.
7. A new dataset is created from this table by grouping the table by activity and subject ID, and then calculating the mean of all the variables per activity and subject. This final dataset is also relabeled to reflect that now each column (with the exception of Subject ID, Activity and Test/Train) is the average of its previous variable values. For example, Standard Deviation - Frequency domain representation of body angular velocity from jerk magnitude from the previous point is now Average of Standard Deviation - Frequency domain representation of body angular velocity from jerk magnitude. This is step 5.0 in the R script. This final data table is called xtable2, and is printed and saved to the global environment.
